This is the source for the SAP Sql Anywhere PHP extension that can be found over here:

https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/display/SQLANY/The+SAP+SQL+Anywhere+PHP+Module

As the provided downloadable binaries only went up until PHP 7.4, I have updated the source to allow it to be compiled for PHP 8.

For steps on how to setup the development environment and compile the extension for a specific PHP version, refer to this guide:
